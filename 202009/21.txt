Survey ID column in offers table is used in Core to fetch the channel of a particular survey during OG. But survey ID is saved in offers table only when Survey is selected as an option in Types Page


1.CASE1: In Types page of survey is selected that time the survey id will be captured in offers table.

2.CASE2: In Offers page if Survey is selected as a reward, Survey id is saved in the reward parameter's expression table against 'survey_id' parameter.
Back-end (CORE) should support both the conditions, CASE1 AND CASE2.
If survey id found in offers table  {
fetch the survey id using the offer id.
QUERY: (Select survey_id from offers where id = offerID);
}  
Else If survey id is NULL in offers table then 
Go to that offer's reward parameters and fetch the survey id using the below query.
QUERY: select * from survey where id in (select CAST(value AS NUMERIC(10)) from expression_tokens where offer_expression_id in(select id from offer_expressions where id in (select expression_parameter_id from reward_parameters where code ='survey_id' and offer_reward_id in (select id from offer_rewards where reward_bag_id in (select id from  offer_reward_bag where act_rew_id  in (select id from offer_action_rewards where action_reward_bag_id in (select action_reward_bag from offers where id = 2230)))))));
3.Support for multiple survey rewards when configured in client.(If Applicable) To select the channel from each survey. - Need to disable from GUI……(Make it configurable to add or not multiple rewards
