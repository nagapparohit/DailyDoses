have started learning spring 5.0

spring provides different ways to access data
to understand how AOP works
familiar with spring related reactive capabilities
implement fully reactive web application
----------------------------------------------------
what is spring framework ?
dependency injection and IOC are pattern which are foundation of spring framework.

jdk8 + jee 7 + baseline no backward compatibility of java 7

reactive support
kotlin support 
all avail in spring 5.
--------------------------------------------------
As a foundation we have spring continer core modules:
  -->Beans
  -->Core
  -->Context 
  -->Spel ( spring expression language)
  above framework provide core functionalities like dependency injection , wiring beans etc etc
  on top of the above module we have modules which provide extras capabilites to spring like AOP , Aspect  , Instrumentation , messaging 
  on top of above we have Web group of moduble which inclue servlet , websocket etc
  and we have Data Access/Interagtion modules like ORM , JDBC, OXM, JMS, Transactions etc.
  --> we have Test Module also test our souce codes
 --------------------------------------------------------
 dependecy injectiona and ioc pattern
 
 the aim of ioc pattern is to provide formalized means to compose application component in simple words its all about remmoving dependency from our source code and make our 
 application loosely coupled , extendable and maintable.
 --------------------------------------------------------
 public class DependencyInjection {

	static class Dependency{
		String doWork() {
			return "work is done";
		}
		
	}
	static class Injected{
		private Dependency dependency;
		
		public Injected(Dependency dependency) {
			this.dependency = dependency;
		}
		
		void delegate() {
			System.out.println(dependency.doWork());
		}
	}	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    /**
    *This is what actually spring does it just instansiate our classes and wire them together,
    */
		Injected injected = new Injected(new Dependency());
		
    /**
    *This part is actually our application logic , so basically after our application was wired from different classes , now it can execute some bussines login 
    */
		injected.delegate();
	}
}

basiscally we have impleentaiton of depdency injection container .


----------------------------------------------------WIRE BEANS--------------------------------------------------------
How spring framework wires beans together ?
setting up spring frame workd ?
spring bean life cycle ?
spring bean scope ?
DI in spring framework ?


----> pojo business objects|                     |
                           |---> spring container|-----> fully confgigurable system 
-------------> meta config |                     |

POJO and meta info is cosumed by spring container in order to produce fully config system for us. during config of our application spring produces intermeditaee
which are called beans from pojo and meta info
