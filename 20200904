Hibernate support CRUD operations by session interface

1.Multiple persistence object's cannot be reterived
2.Multiple update and delete operations are not possible
3. Required criterion can't be expressed to perform some complex CRUD Operation

To overome abover limitation we have:
HQL
criterina api
Native SQL

HQL is defined by hibernal , it doenot depend on the table of the database , it depend upon the classes.

cretieria api
its one way of querying the db in hibernate 
it can be used for DML operations
creteria api is an object oriented after native for HQL to read data from database.
cretiean api support compile time checking the querying that we build unlike the HQL

one's session is created using session factory 
we can  begin ttranscation using sesssion.benginTranzsaction()
//CREATE A RECORD
object = new Person();
session.save(oabject)
transcation.commit();
session.close()

//READ/GET a RECORD
so if we want to retrieve a record
Player p = session.get(Player.class,1) // let say we wwant first record so we give key as 1
transacion.commit();
session.close()

//UPDATE A RECORD
to update a record we just need to use set method after getting a record
Player p = session.get(Player.class,1) // let say we wwant first record so we give key as 1
p.setName("anas")
transacion.commit();
session.close()

//DELETE A RECORD
now suppose uou want to delete a record for that we just need to use session.delete after getting a record
Player p = session.get(Player.class,1) // let say we wwant first record so we give key as 1
session.delete(p);
transacion.commit();
session.close()


//While saving if we want to auto generated a value we can give annotation GeneratedValue(staregry=GenetatyepType.IDENTY) in class defintion
@ID
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private id;

//now if we save 
p1=new Persn("ewqe",10);
session.save(p1)
transacation.commit();
session.close();

//if you don not want null value to stored in you can set 
@Columne(nullable=false,name="col name in db")
privat rollno

//wiht HOL we cannot perform Create opertion we can only perform read update and delete opertion
