Hibernate support CRUD operations by session interface

1.Multiple persistence object's cannot be reterived
2.Multiple update and delete operations are not possible
3. Required criterion can't be expressed to perform some complex CRUD Operation

To overome abover limitation we have:
HQL
criterina api
Native SQL

HQL is defined by hibernal , it doenot depend on the table of the database , it depend upon the classes.

cretieria api
its one way of querying the db in hibernate 
it can be used for DML operations
creteria api is an object oriented after native for HQL to read data from database.
cretiean api support compile time checking the querying that we build unlike the HQL
