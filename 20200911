Following is the list of few of the great benefits of using Spring Framework:

Lightweight − Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of spring framework is around 2MB.

Inversion of control (IOC) − Loose coupling is achieved in spring using the technique Inversion of Control. The objects give their dependencies instead of creating or looking for dependent objects.

Aspect oriented (AOP) − Spring supports Aspect oriented programming and enables cohesive development by separating application business logic from system services.

Container − Spring contains and manages the life cycle and configuration of application objects.

MVC Framework − Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as Struts or other over engineered or less popular web frameworks.

Transaction Management − Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using JTA, for example).

Exception Handling − Spring provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.
